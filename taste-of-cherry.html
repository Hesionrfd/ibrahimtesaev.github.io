      <p>I had been going through a season of noise: external, internal, unspoken, and for reasons I couldn’t name, I wanted a film that wouldn’t speak too loudly. Revisiting <em>Taste of Cherry</em> seemed exactly what I was looking for—not to analyze, not to write but to simply sit beside something that had once spoken to me with a quiet, gentle persistence.</p>

      <p>It is a story that refuses to be moral, refuses to make itself legible through the obvious. A man looking to die drives through the edge of Iran asking strangers to help him with his burial. Each encounter isn’t a scene, but a moment of being. No drama. No explosion. Just conversation. Just waiting. Just moving.</p>

      <p>At one point, he tells a man: “This is not suicide. This is different.” And yet, he doesn’t explain. And yet, I understood.</p>

      <p>This film taught me how to listen — not to plot, but to pause. It taught me that the most devastating moments don’t arrive with thunder but in silence. That the most profound dialogues are those that don’t pretend to explain but only wish to be heard.</p>

      <p>Watching *Taste of Cherry* this time wasn’t about death. It was about waiting beside someone — someone who needed to be met exactly where they are. And isn’t that what love is? What cinema, at its best, can offer?</p>

      <p>I watched it to hear a silence I had once known. And somehow, it spoke again.</p>
