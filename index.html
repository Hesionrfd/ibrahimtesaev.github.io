      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>The first memory of my childhood that I can remember of is sitting in front of a TV and watching movies on VHS, Disks, different weird Channels. I sometimes joke that movies taught me how to live (of course, my mother hates this joke), but that is the truth. Watching movies is not just a kind of entertainment for me, but also a form of learning, living different lives, going though different experiences. In the core of any film is a script written by a human who went through something in their life and decided to write about it. Therefore, everything I see on a screen - characters, stories, dialogues - it all makes sense to me, because they were based on something real, something from this world. Unpacking a film that is stuck with me is truly an amazing experience, writing about it, feeling it, analyzing. And I want to share this with you. </p>

      Taste of Cherry: A Story on Wanting to Leave and Learning to Stay
    </a>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <p>
        This piece reflects on <em>Taste of Cherry</em> not as a film about death, but as a meditation on the quiet, uncertain space before it. Through the story of Mr. Badii and his search for someone to bury him, I explore how cinema can hold our silences, our grief, and even our mercy. Inspired by Islamic thought and personal reflection, it is an essay about staying, listening, and how something as simple as a fruit – a mulberry – can be a sign to stay.

      How Films Shape Our Understanding of Reality: A Close-Up on Abbas Kiarostami
    </a>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <p>
        This article unpacks Abbas Kiarostami’s <em>Close-Up</em> as a poetic and philosophical inquiry into identity, deception, and our hunger to be seen. It explores how cinema can become a mirror, not just a lens – asking us to question what’s real, what’s performance, and how compassion emerges when we choose to listen instead of judge. Drawing on narrative theory and Islamic ethics, it argues that Sabzian’s “fraud” was in fact a cry to belong – and that art can offer a kind of truth no confession can.
