      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
  The first memory of my childhood I can remember is sitting in front of a TV, watching movies on VHS tapes, disks, and strange channels. I sometimes joke that movies taught me how to live (of course, my mother hates that joke), but it’s true. Watching films isn’t just entertainment for me - it’s a way of learning, of living other lives, of going through different experiences.
</p>

<p>
  At the core of every film is a script written by someone who went through something and decided to shape it into a story. That’s why everything I see on screen - the characters, the stories, the dialogues - makes sense to me. They’re built on something real.
</p>

<p>
  Unpacking a film that stays with me is more than writing - it’s experiencing, feeling, analyzing. And I want to share that with you.

      Searching for the Unseen: La Chimera and the Ache of What Can’t Be Held
    </a>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <p>
        In this piece I explore grief, faith, and the beauty of longing without resolution. The story is a quiet meditation on Arthur, a tomb raider not in search of gold but of a memory - a ghostly presence bound to the earth by a red thread. Through ruins, puddles, and silence, he grieves not to reclaim the past, but simply to be near it. <em>La Chimera</em> becomes a reflection on ghayb, the Islamic concept of the unseen - what cannot be touched or explained, but is deeply felt.

      Taste of Cherry: A Story on Wanting to Leave and Learning to Stay
    </a>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <p>
        This piece reflects on <em>Taste of Cherry</em> not as a film about death, but as a meditation on the quiet, uncertain space before it. Through the story of Mr. Badii and his search for someone to bury him, I explore how cinema can hold our silences, our grief, and even our mercy. Inspired by Islamic thought and personal reflection, it is an essay about staying, listening, and how something as simple as a fruit – a mulberry – can be a sign to stay.

      How Films Shape Our Understanding of Reality: A Close-Up on Abbas Kiarostami
    </a>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <p>
        This article unpacks Abbas Kiarostami’s <em>Close-Up</em> as a poetic and philosophical inquiry into identity, deception, and our hunger to be seen. It explores how cinema can become a mirror, not just a lens – asking us to question what’s real, what’s performance, and how compassion emerges when we choose to listen instead of judge. Drawing on narrative theory and Islamic ethics, it argues that Sabzian’s “fraud” was in fact a cry to belong – and that art can offer a kind of truth no confession can.
