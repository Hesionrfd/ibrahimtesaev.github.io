    <p>And what is hope, if not imagination refusing to die?</p>

    <p>The other night I rewatched <em>I’m Thinking of Ending Things</em>. As it usually happens with me after a strange narrative of a film, this one stuck with me as well, and in order to get free, I have to write. Writing about Charlie Kaufman’s films means writing about the states of being, not about stories in the traditional sense. And this one, perhaps more than any other, captures what it feels like when imagination becomes your only companion, when your inner world is more vivid, more generous to you, and in some sense, more unbearable than the one outside. The house keeps changing, the parents too, the girl changes as well, but the one thing remains: the solitude of a man constructing his life from fragments because reality gave him too little to hold on to.</p>

    <p>On the surface, <em>I’m Thinking of Ending Things</em> follows a story of a young woman traveling with her boyfriend, Jake, to meet his parents at their farmhouse. As snow falls and tension increases, the visit grows increasingly surreal - the dog won’t stop shaking, the parents shift between ages, and reality seems to slip. But this is not her story. It’s all about Jake and his unlived life trying to rewrite memories through imagination and fictional fragments, people, and pieces of his life.</p>

    <p>The farmhouse creeks with memory, or rather with invention of it. It’s less of a place and more of a stage set rearranged with every passing thought.  Jake’s imagination is building the house, and it doesn’t need to follow the rules of physics, only  the logic of the narrator’s longing for perfection. But the house is not the only thing built by imagination, Jake’s girlfriend is another example of it. Lucy at the beginning, then Lousia, Ames, or just “young woman” transforms from a person to the projection of a girlfriend as we go deeper into the narrative and imagination of the janitor. She exists because he needs someone to talk to and listen to him, someone to remember what he never had. But as she begins to realize that she doesn’t really exist, the walls of the story begin to collapse.</p>

    <p><em>“I am thinking of ending things…”</em>, says Lucy over and over again in her mind, as she repeats it as a mantra. But who is she speaking to? Herself, maybe? Or is it Jake’s mind subconsciously trying to speak through her? Is he thinking of ending the created fantasy? The never-existing girlfriend Lucy? Or, maybe, even himself? </p>

    <p>Jake’s loneliness is a some kind of ritual, not an emotion in its usual sense, as he devotes himself to remembering what never happened, replaying scenes that never took place: that car drive with Lucy was never real, it was just the after-thought of “what could have been” inside Jake’s mind; Lucy was probably a face of a woman he once saw somewhere and never dared to talk to. Jake doesn’t even want a girlfriend, he needs a witness, someone to prove his existence, even if that someone is imaginable.</p>

    <p>Aching need to be seen slowly devours Jake’s mind, and when the mind became the only space left to inhabit, imagination transformed from a gift into a burden, a prison, a stage that wouldn’t let Jake to escape anymore. On that stage, Jake creates himself into a Nobel Prize winner, then he sings, he performs and transforms  for the audience. But even then, no one claps. And there lies the tragedy: not just being alone, but knowing that everything you created in your mind - every character, places, dialogues - in the end, can’t save you from yourself. The parents die, the girlfriend disappears, the house empties. And, finally, the snow buries everything. </p>

    <p>As Lucy once said - or Jake, through her - <em>“Other animals live in the present. Humans cannot. So they invented hope.”</em></p>
