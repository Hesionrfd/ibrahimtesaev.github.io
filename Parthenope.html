    <p><em>"And as the summer fades away, nothing gold can stay."</em></p>

    <p>Naples. The sea at dusk that carries both salt and myth of a siren whose voice brought sailors to their doom and who threw herself into the sea after Ulysses resisted her temptation of beauty. It is here that Paolo Sorrentino sets his <em>Parthenope</em>, a film that feels like a tide – arriving, departing, returning again, never to be held.</p>


    <p>Parthenope. What a beautiful name. She is a siren of Naples, who moves through the film as a vision of beauty that both blesses and burdens, a beauty never still, always slipping. Watching her is like watching a summer sunset: shining precisely because you know it is already vanishing. And while you look at it, while you feel the disappearance of it, comes the question that was whispered through the film’s imagery: what does it mean to witness beauty that cannot last?</p>

    <p>Arthur’s longing for something untouchable got me thinking about <strong>ghayb</strong>, which in the Islamic world means the unseen. It refers to everything beyond human perception; we can’t touch it, can’t see it nor explain – but still feel. Like we feel love, afterlife, or longing, or like we feel soul. <em>La Chimera</em> feels like a meditation on <strong>ghayb</strong>. It stretches the idea of the unseen through the whole film, capturing one man with this desire to touch the feeling, to hold it in his arms like he once held her before. Arthur digs into the ground but the ache, or the cure from it, is upward – toward a ghost he can’t name.</p>

    <p>Alice Rohrwacher, the writer and director of the film, doesn’t give us answers but little pieces as if we should try to complete a puzzle, and those pieces consist of crumbling statues, buried faces, the woman who may or may not be still there tied with a red string. But in all that, we sense that this story is too sacred to be looked at as a puzzle, logic is useless here, language – too loud. Maybe, just maybe, not every story needs to be understood? What if we look at it as an experience of the unseen? Unseen can’t be touched, explained, and <em>La Chimera</em> is the same… in a way.</p>

    <p>Arthur, the one who goes through the unseen, never tries to bring her back, he never clings nor begs, and he never tries to explain. His devotion is quiet like a breeze, and it's definitely not transactional because he doesn’t want to own the past, he only wants to be near it. By sleeping in the house where she once lived, walking through the fields where she might have stood, Arthur tries to feel the presence of the past.</p>

    <p><strong>Preservation.</strong> We truly live in a world obsessed with it: trying to preserve young beauty and lust in a glass case, posting everything just to look back and never move on, living in delusion. And while watching <em>La Chimera</em>, I learnt that some things are meant to pass through us, not stay with us. We are not offered resolution but nearness that feels like the ache of being close to something that once held you, even if it no longer can.</p>

    <p><em>La Chimera</em> ends but nothing is resolved: Arthur walks through ruins, through dreams, through absence, and we are not told what he finds or if he finds anything at all. But maybe that is the point? The point that we should keep searching even when we no longer know what we are searching for. Grief isn’t always loud, it just sits beside you. A coat never taken off, a breath held just a little too long, a body moving through the world like it is still waiting to be called home.</p>

    <p>The unseen, <strong>al-ghayb</strong>, is not beyond us – it’s with us. That longing is a kind of faith. That presence doesn’t always need to be held, sometimes it just needs to be remembered.</p>
